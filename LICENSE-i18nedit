License for I18NEdit
--------------------

I18NEdit is an open source program released under the FSF GPL license. You
can find the complete license document either on the Web server of the Free
Software Foundation or below the doc/ directory as gpl.txt

Releasing I18NEdit under the GPL license means, that you can use and modify
the source code of I18NEdit in your own GPL or GPL-compatible Open Source
projects. Simply using I18NEdit for internationalization of a project does
not imply anything for the license of that particular project. As you may
use the gcc C compiler to create closed source or proprietary software, you
can take I18NEdit to work on your closed source/proprietary program to
localize it.
